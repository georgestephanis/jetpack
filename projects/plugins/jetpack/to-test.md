## Jetpack 14.6

### Before you start:

- **At any point during your testing, remember to [check your browser's JavaScript console](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-your-browser-to-diagnose-javascript-errors/#step-3-diagnosis) and see if there are any errors reported by Jetpack there.**
- Use the "Debug Bar" or "Query Monitor" WordPress plugins to help make PHP notices and warnings more noticeable and report anything of note you see.
- You may need to connect Jetpack to a WordPress.com account to test some features, find out how to do that [here](https://jetpack.com/support/getting-started-with-jetpack/).
- Blocks in beta status require a small change for you to be able to test them. You can do either of the following:
  - Edit your `wp-config.php` file to include: `define( 'JETPACK_BLOCKS_VARIATION', 'beta' );`
  - Or add the following to something like a code snippet plugin: `add_filter( 'jetpack_blocks_variation', function () { return 'beta'; } );`
	- To test Breve further in the document please enable the feature with the following snippet: `add_filter( 'breve_enabled', '__return_true' );`

You can see a [full list of changes in this release here](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack-production/blob/trunk/CHANGELOG.md). Please feel free to test any and all functionality mentioned!

**Thank you for all your help!**

### Code quality

This release cycle was largely focused around quality, so there aren't many features to test. We've made a push to clean up a large number of PHP warnings and errors. Often the hardest part is determining how to reproduce issues, so try to break things by doing the unexpected, keeping special note of the steps taken and any errors triggered.
